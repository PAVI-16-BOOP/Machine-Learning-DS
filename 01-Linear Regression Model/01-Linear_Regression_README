🛍️ 1. Background & Problem Statement

A clothing and styling E-commerce company operates both online (website + mobile app) and offline styling stores. Customers often visit physical stores for styling advice and later place orders through the app or website.
The company wants to understand which factors drive the Yearly Amount Spent (YAS) and specifically whether they should invest more into:
  Improving the mobile app,
  Enhancing the website, or
  Focusing on other customer-related metrics.

Using customer data (session behavior, membership length, usage patterns, etc.), we analyze which variables most strongly influence annual spending.

🔎 2. Approach Followed
 The following workflow was used: 
  * Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.Ran basic EDA: distributions, pairplots, correlation checks, and patterns across features.
  * Looked closely at the main variables:
    -Avg. Session Length
    -Time on App
    -Time on Website
    -Length of Membership
  
  * Built a multivariate linear regression model to understand which features actually impact Yearly Amount Spent.
  * Split the data, trained the model, checked coefficients, and reviewed residuals to make sure the model behaved well.
  * Used the coefficient values to interpret which factors truly matter for customer spending.

💡 3. Insights Gained

Based on the statistical analysis and regression coefficients:

✅ Length of Membership
  This comes out as the strongest predictor of Yearly Amount Spent.Customers who stay longer with the company tend to spend more.
  This makes sense — long-term customers trust the brand, explore more offerings, and return frequently.
  ➡️ Conclusion: Investing in improving loyalty, retention, or membership programs can drive revenue more reliably than purely optimizing app/website usage.

🔄 Time on App vs Time on Website
  Both contribute, but with different strengths:
    -Time on App generally shows a slightly stronger positive correlation with spending than Time on Website.
    -Website traffic may be higher, but app engagement seems more efficient (higher spend per unit time).

📊 Avg. Session Length
  While not the strongest predictor, the trend you observed is correct:
     -Higher session length often aligns with higher spending,
     -Peak YAS occurs around Avg. Session Length ~34–35,
     -Lower YAS appears around Avg. Session Length ~30–31.
  It’s not the dominant factor, but it does contribute meaningfully.

➡️ Final Conclusion:
  You can reasonably argue either:
    “Boost website traffic,” or
    “Improve app experience since it converts better.”
  Both interpretations are valid based on the coefficients and plots.Encouraging deeper browsing or improving recommendation flow could indirectly increase spending.
