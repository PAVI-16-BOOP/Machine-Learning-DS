📌 1. Background & Problem Statement

  This project analyzes the classic Titanic dataset, containing information like age, sex, passenger class, fare, and more.
  The goal is to build a Logistic Regression model that predicts whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).
  
  The objectives include:
   -Understanding survival patterns
   -Cleaning missing data
   -Building a predictive model
   -Interpreting which features matter most

🔎 2. Approach Followed
  ✔ Data Exploration
  
  Inspected columns, missing values, and basic dataset structure.Performed EDA to analyze:
  
  Gender vs Survival

  ![Gender_v/s_Survival][]
  
  Passenger Class trends
  
  Fare and Age distributions
  
  Correlation patterns
