1. Background & Problem Statement

  LendingClub connects borrowers seeking loans with investors who fund them. As an investor, the key question is simple: “Will this borrower pay me back?”
  This project uses publicly available LendingClub data (2007–2010) to build predictive models that estimate whether a borrower will fully repay the loan or default.
  The dataset includes borrower credit profiles such as:
  
  fico (credit score)
  int.rate (interest rate)
  credit.policy (whether borrower meets LendingClub underwriting rules)
  purpose of loan
  not.fully.paid (target variable),etc.
  
  The goal is to explore the factors influencing defaults and build ML models — Decision Tree and Random Forest — to classify borrowers into defaulters and non-defaulters.

2. Approach Followed

  The workflow for this project was:
  
    ✔ Data Exploration & Visualization
    
      Compared FICO score distributions between borrowers who met vs. failed credit policy.

      Analyzed how interest rate varies with FICO score, credit policy, and repayment status.
      
      Observed strong risk signals: lower FICO and higher interest rate correlate with higher chance of default.
    
    ✔ Data Preprocessing
    
      Removed/handled missing values as required.
      
      Converted categorical features (e.g., purpose) to dummy/one-hot variables.
      
      Split data into training and testing sets.
      
    ✔ Model Training
    
      Two ML models were evaluated:
      
      Decision Tree Classifier
      
      Simple baseline model.
      
      Helps understand key decision rules the model learns.
      
      Random Forest Classifier
      
      Ensemble of multiple decision trees.
      
      Used bootstrapping + random feature selection to reduce overfitting.
      
      Achieved better generalization and accuracy compared to a single tree.
    
    ✔ Model Evaluation
    
      Compared predictions on the test set.
      
      Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

3. Insights Gained
  🔹 FICO score strongly impacts repayment
  
    Borrowers with higher FICO scores:
    
    Get lower interest rates
    
    Are more likely to repay their loans
    
    Are mostly approved under credit.policy = 1
    
    Those with lower scores show higher default rates.
    
  🔹 Higher interest rates correlate with higher default probability
  
    Even for borrowers passing the credit policy, high interest rates increase risk.
    
  🔹 Borrowers who fail credit policy (credit.policy = 0) are much riskier
  
    They cluster around:
    
    Lower FICO
    
    Higher interest
    
    Higher default rates
  
  🔹 Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree
  
    Better handling of noise and non-linearity
    
    Reduced overfitting
    
    Gave more stable predictions
    
  🔹 Feature importance
  
    Random Forest identified:
    
    fico
    
    int.rate
    
    credit.policy
    
    purpose
    
    as the strongest predictors of default.
